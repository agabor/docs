# Getting Started

The REST API lets you interact with MSG Server from anything that can send an HTTP request. There are many things you can do with the REST API. For example:

*   A mobile website can access MSG Server data from JavaScript.
*   A web server can show data from MSG Server on a website.
*   You can upload large amounts of data that will later be consumed in a mobile app.
*   You can download recent data to run your own custom analytics.
*   Applications written in any programming language can interact with data on MSG Server.
